# How to create Redux actions / action creators?

This repo lists some way to create Redux actions and action creators, along with their pros and cons.

Each method is in its own directory, with two files:
- `creation.js`: Shows the way actions and creators are created. At the top is a comment listing the method pros & cons.
- `usage.js`: Shows the resulting actions/creators usage.

If you read this and notice I'm wrong and/or know a better way, please let me know. :heart:
