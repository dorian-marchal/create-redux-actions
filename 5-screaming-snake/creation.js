 * Same as middleground but with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (the one I prefer :)).
 *
 * Pros:
 * - Dry.
 * - Little code.
 * - Flux Standard Action constraint.
 * - IDE autocompletion.
 * - Grepable.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Little "magic" (createAction).
 * - Still indirection.
 * - In reducers, casting is needed for types.
 * - Less conventional (action creators aren't in camelCase).

// `createAction` wrapper.
// Takes the same arguments than `createAction`, except the `type`.
// It returns a partially executed `createAction` that can be called with the
// action `type` to finish its creation.
function action(...args) {
  return (type) => createAction(type, ...args);
}

// Starts the process of creating action creators.
// This is done in two steps for these reasons:
// - It helps being DRY: `createAction` doesn't need the type right away,
//   so it can be defined once as the property name.
// - It allows most IDE to autocomplete imported actions.
// The first requirement could be solved by using redux-actions `createActions`
// but it would prevent the second one from being met.
